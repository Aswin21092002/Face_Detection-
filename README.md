Project Name: Uniform Detection System

Description:
Developed a sophisticated Uniform Detection System using OpenCV and Python to enforce dress code compliance within an organization. The system leverages computer vision techniques to automatically detect whether employees are wearing the required uniform by recognizing the company logo on their attire. When an employee fails to adhere to the dress code, the system records this as an absence and initiates a fine, thereby maintaining strict adherence to dress code policies. This automated approach not only simplifies monitoring but also ensures consistent enforcement of uniform policies, enhancing overall workplace compliance.

Technologies Used: OpenCV, Python, Image Processing, Computer Vision
